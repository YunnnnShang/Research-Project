Investigating the Effects of Camera Degradations on the Performance of Selected Image Recognition Algorithms
# About The Project
Within the scope of a research project focused on predictive maintenance for distributed systems, a fleet of robots is currently being assembled as a demonstrator. Each robot, in addition to other sensors, is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 5, to which a camera is connected. This work initially aims to implement image processing algorithms on the Raspberry Pi, tailored for object detection, segmentation, or motion detection, considering the limited resources available. Furthermore, the algorithms will be trained to recognize other robots. An additional phase involves exploring how certain camera degradations might affect the performance of these image processing algorithms. These degradations must be induced either physically or through software manipulation. For a deeper understanding of the subject, [1] may be consulted. [1] Y. Pei, Y. Huang, Q. Zou, H. Zang, Z.
